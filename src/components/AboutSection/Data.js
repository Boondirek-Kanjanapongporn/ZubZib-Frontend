        Zubzib's objective is to connect everyone through the power of Online Internet. With Zubzib, We want to create a Community, Society, \
        and Family for everyone. In this project, we divided Zubzib into 2 sectionsâ€” Frontend and Backend. For Frontend, we used React Framework to build \
        our website. The languages involve Javascript, HTML5, and CSS. For Backend, in the other hand, we used Spring Frameworkâ€” which is \
        built by Java language. The Spring Boot Framework is responsible for connecting Zubzib to a database, Login/Signup Interface, \
        Login Authenticator, Web security, and Websocket. We hope that Zubzib can, one day, contribute to real-based implementation.\
         Much Love, from Zubzib creators. :)",
